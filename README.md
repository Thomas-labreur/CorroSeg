This repositry contains the deep learning project I performed in 2024 during my second year of SID master degree. This project takes place in the Deep Learning lecture taught by Emmanuelle Claeys. 

Here is a description of contents:

- main.ipynb is the notebook that contains all the main presentation of the project: data retrieval, pre-processing, augmentation, model's training and evaluations.
- iou.py is a library with a function to compute IoU, the main performance metric I used in the project.
- data_utils.py is a library with a function to pre-process data and another for data augmentation
- the data folder contains all the data that were given for the project, and also the final submission csv file.
- the models folder contains .h5 files with the different model's weights obtained after training.
